Radiocarbon is a critical constraint on our estimates of the timescales of soil carbon cycling that can aid in identifying mechanisms of carbon stabilization and destabilization and improve the forecast of soil carbon response to management or environmental change. Despite the wealth of soil radiocarbon data that have been reported over the past 75 years, the ability to apply these data to global-scale questions is limited by our capacity to synthesize and compare measurements generate",

Breast tumor heterogeneity is a major factor contributing to drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis after chemotherapy.

However, these ADCs often suffer from issues associated with intratumor heterogeneity. Here, we show that homoge",

Due to these reasons, artificial intelligence-based algorithms have become the most popular tools for researchers. This study discusses state-of-the-art art",

    "abstract": "E-commerce chatbots face critical limitations that undermine customer trust: hallucinations from ungrounded responses, poor multi-turn coherence, and an inability to execute real-world actions such as processing refunds or verifying live inventory. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches address knowledge grounding and reasoning, respectively, yet remain fundamentally passive—they inform but cannot act. We present a unified agentic framework that integ",

In the LLM and AI era, architects increasingly treat foundation models as production dependencies, which introduces probabilistic behavior, new security threats [14], and operational quality metrics beyond availability and latency. This evolution demands both deep technical expertise, including containerized workloads, microservices, transient inf",

This builds on the capabilities of pre-trained language models by integrating them into tool-using systems, performing accurate calculations, and supporting multi-agent systems, sometimes in conjunction with human operators and sometimes independently. They all follow a similar pattern of using self-supervised learning to allow agents to self-invoke and control e",
